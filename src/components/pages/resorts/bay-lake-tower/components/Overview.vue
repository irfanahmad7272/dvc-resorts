                The crescent-shaped Bay Lake Tower blends modern architectural sensibilities with
                the trademark visual cues of its influential neighbor, Disneyâ€™s Contemporary Resort.
                <br />
                Defined by glass-wrapped columns and warm woven woods, Bay Lake Tower is
                conveniently located within walking distance of restaurants, tennis courts, a health
                club, and other recreational activities. <br />
                After a fun-filled day at Magic Kingdom, walking back to your room is a breeze and
                only takes a few minutes. <br />
                Enjoy views of the courtyard, pool, Bay Lake, and Magic Kingdom from the Sky Way
                Bridge, which connects Bay Lake Tower with Disney's Contemporary Resort. <br />
                The bridge links you to shops, restaurants, and the monorail station inside the
                Contemporary.
