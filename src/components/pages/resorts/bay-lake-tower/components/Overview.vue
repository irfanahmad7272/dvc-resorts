                The crescent-shaped Bay Lake Tower blends modern architectural
                sensibilities with the trademark visual cues of its influential
                neighbor, Disneyâ€™s Contemporary Resort. Defined by glass-wrapped
                columns and warm woven woods, Bay Lake Tower is conveniently
                located within walking distance of restaurants, tennis courts, a
                health club, and other recreational activities. After a
                fun-filled day at Magic Kingdom, walking back to your room is a
                breeze and only takes a few minutes. Enjoy views of the
                courtyard, pool, Bay Lake, and Magic Kingdom from the Sky Way
                Bridge, which connects Bay Lake Tower with Disney's Contemporary
                Resort. The bridge links you to shops, restaurants, and the
                monorail station inside the Contemporary.
