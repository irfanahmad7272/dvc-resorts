                Experience the magic of Hawaii at Disneyâ€™s Aulani Resort and
                Spa. Located on the white-sand beaches of Oahu, the Villas of
                Aulani overlook the Pacific Ocean, a breathtaking lagoon, and a
                tropical cove that defines the term "paradise on Earth."
                "Aulani" means "messenger of a chief," and it's here that you'll
                explore everything the Hawaiian islands have to offer. Set back
                from the crowds of Waikiki but close enough to enjoy its
                attractions, Aulani is nestled between mountain ranges and
                calming ocean waves. In addition to all the world-class
                amenities you expect from a Disney Resort, there are
                island-themed activities for all to enjoy. Matched only by the
                spectacular beauty of the islands, the atmosphere and
                experiences of Aulani will put the Disney spark of magic into
                your Hawaiian getaway.
