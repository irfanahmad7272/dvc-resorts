                We are a husband and wife team and former DVC cast members. We
                have 25 years of experience selling DVC memberships directly for
                the Walt Disney Company. We know the process of becoming a
                Disney Vacation Club member inside and out! Now that we have our
                own DVC resale business, we use our knowledge of Disney Vacation
                Club to help you become a DVC member for 30-50% less than direct
                Disney pricing.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve assisted thousands of families over the years, and
                continue to help families through our DVC resale business. Read
                our <a class="text-custom-orange2" href="#">testimonials</a> to
